Signature
Signature of IU.svg
Lee Ji-eun (Korean: ???; born May 16, 1993[1]), also known by her stage name IU (Korean: ???), is a South Korean singer-songwriter, record producer, and actress. She signed with LOEN Entertainment (now Kakao Entertainment) in 2007 as a trainee and debuted as a singer at the age of fifteen with her first extended play (EP) Lost and Found (2008). Although her follow-up albums, Growing Up and IU...IM, brought mainstream success, it was only after the release of "Good Day" (Korean: ?? ?), the lead single from her 2010 album Real, that she achieved national stardom. "Good Day" went on to spend five consecutive weeks at the top of South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart, and in 2019, it was ranked number one on Billboard's "100 Greatest K-Pop Songs of the 2010s" list.[2]

With the success of her 2011 albums, Real+ and Last Fantasy, IU established herself as a formidable force on the music charts of her native country and further cemented her girl next door image as Korea's "little sister".[3][4] 2011 also saw her first foray into songwriting with "Hold My Hand", which was written for the television series The Greatest Love. IU's third studio album, Modern Times (2013), showcased a more mature musical style that marked a departure from her earlier girlish image, with several tracks reaching the top 10 on the Gaon Digital Chart. The album was ranked number two on Billboard's "25 Greatest K-Pop Albums of the 2010s" list.[5] IU subsequently exerted more creative control over her music; Chat-Shire marked the first time she was credited as the sole lyricist of her own album.[6] IU's fourth studio album, Palette (2017), became her first to reach number one on Billboard's World Albums chart. While her following records Love Poem and Lilac continued to deviate from mainstream K-pop styles, exploring and mixing various music genres, IU consistently retained her dominance on South Korean music charts.[7][8][9] Her 2020 single "Eight" became her first to reach number one on the Billboard World Digital Song Sales chart.[10]

Aside from her music career, IU has ventured into acting and hosting radio and television shows. Following her supporting role in teen drama Dream High (2011) and minor appearances in several television series, she was cast in leading roles in television drama series You Are the Best! (2013), Pretty Man (2013每14), The Producers (2015) and Moon Lovers: Scarlet Heart Ryeo (2016). IU's role as a desperate office worker in My Mister (2018) received critical acclaim, and she earned her first Best Actress in Television nomination at the 55th Baeksang Arts Awards. In 2019, she starred in anthology film series Persona and fantasy television series Hotel del Luna, the latter of which led to her second Best Actress nomination at the Baeksang Arts Awards. In 2022, IU starred in Hirokazu Kore-eda's film Broker alongside Song Kang-ho, Bae Doona and Gang Dong-won.

IU has released a total of five studio albums and nine EPs, five of which have reached number one on the Gaon Album Chart, and thirty number-one singles, making her the artist with the most number-one songs in South Korea. One of the best-selling solo acts in the group-dominated K-pop industry,[11] IU became the first solo female K-pop act to perform at the Olympic Gymnastics Arena during the Seoul leg of her 2019 Love, Poem concert tour [12] and also the first Korean female artist to hold a solo concert, The Golden Hour, at Seoul Olympic Stadium in Seoul on September 17 and 18, 2022.[13] Rolling Stone named her the 135th greatest singer of all time in a 2023 ranking.[14] She has been included five times in the top ten of Forbes magazine's annual Korea Power Celebrity list since 2012 and attained a peak ranking of number three that year.[15] In 2014, Billboard recognized IU as the all-time leader of its K-pop Hot 100 with the most number-one songs and the artist with the most weeks at the number-one position on the chart.[16] She was named Gallup Korea's Singer of the Year in 2014 and in 2017.[17][18]

Early life
IU was born Lee Ji-eun on May 16, 1993, in Songjeong-dong, Seoul, South Korea.[19][20] At an early age, IU showed interest in pursuing a career in the entertainment industry and began attending acting classes.[21] Following her elementary school years, her family's financial situation deteriorated, and they eventually moved to the nearby Uijeongbu, in Gyeonggi Province.[22] She and her younger brother lived apart from their parents in a studio room with their grandmother and cousin for over one year in conditions of great poverty.[23][24] IU had little contact with her parents over this period of time, but felt reassured under her grandmother's care.[24]

During her middle school years, IU found her passion for singing and decided to become a singer after being applauded for a performance she gave at her school's sports competition.[25] She attended 20 auditions but failed to succeed in any of them, and was also scammed by fake entertainment companies.[26][27] She later trained at Good Entertainment with Uee, Yubin, Heo Ga-yoon, and Jun Hyo-seong.[28] After signing with LOEN Entertainment in 2007, she moved to Bangbae, Seoul.[29] Due to her poor living conditions at the time, IU stated that she "loved being at the studio", where she could eat as much as she wanted and had a place to sleep.[24]

Her burgeoning career led to her decreased attendance at school and declining grades, with the exception of Korean literature.[30] After graduating from Dongduk Girls' High School [ko] in 2012, IU decided not to pursue post-secondary education in tandem with her singing career.[31]

Career
2008每2009: Career beginnings

IU performing "Boo" on October 29, 2009.
After training for ten months, IU made her debut in 2008 under her stage name, conceived by LOEN to mean "I and You become one through music."[32] She performed her debut single, "Lost Child" (Korean: ??), live for the first time on the music program M Countdown on September 18, 2008, making it her debut performance as a professional singer.[33] IU recalled the crowd had hurled insults at her during the performance and initially felt discouraged by it, although she now considers it a beneficial experience.[34] "Lost Child" is the lead single from her debut extended play (EP) Lost and Found, which was released on September 24, 2008. For the album, IU was awarded the "Rookie of the Month" by South Korea's Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism in November that same year.[35] However, the album did not do well commercially. During an interview in 2011, IU said, "My first album failed, but I'm grateful for that. If I had become successful as soon as I made my debut, I wouldn't appreciate my staff members and the popularity that I'm enjoying now."[30]

On April 23, 2009, IU launched her first studio album, Growing Up, with the lead promotional single, "Boo". She began her album promotion the next day, performing "Boo" on KBS2's Music Bank.[36] The song was noted for its stark contrast in musical style to "Lost Child", which was described as a "heavy" and "dark" ballad compared to the 1980s "retro sound" of "Boo".[37][38] Deemed as a "strategic" transformation, the dance choreography, stage costume and hairstyle shown in live performances were used to emphasize her youthfulness and project a "cute" image.[37][39] Although it drew a favorable response from the public, IU, who was fifteen years old at the time, admitted that the image made her feel awkward.[39] Several songs from Lost and Found were featured on her debut studio album Growing Up, including "You Know" (Korean: ?? ?); a new rock-style arrangement of the song was released as the follow-up single to "Boo". Towards the end of 2009, IU released her second EP, IU...IM. She began promoting its lead single, "Marshmallow" (Korean: ?????), on music programs from November 13, 2009. Recalling the performances, IU stated on a 2013 episode of Happy Together that she disliked having to wear the girlish costumes and hairstyle fashioned for the song promotions.[40] The performances were well-received and were once again labelled "cute", reminiscent of reviews for "Boo".[41]

As her popularity began to rise, IU made more frequent appearances on variety shows, performing on Star Golden Bell, Kim Jung-eun's Chocolate, and You Hee-yeol's Sketchbook. Her acoustic covers of other artists' songs such as Girls' Generation's "Gee", Super Junior's "Sorry, Sorry", and Big Bang's "Lies" featured in these live performances gained tremendous interest online.[42] In late 2009, she became a television presenter for the first time, hosting a weekly music chart show on Gom TV,[43] while appearing as a fixed guest on multiple radio programs such as Kiss the Radio, Volume Up, MBC Standard FM's Starry Night and MBC FM4U's Best Friend Radio.[44][45]

2010每2011: Rising popularity and acting debut
On June 3, 2010, IU released "Nagging" (Korean: ???), a duet which she recorded with 2AM's Lim Seul-ong. The single debuted at twelve on the Gaon Digital Chart and shot up to the number-one position the following week, where it remained for three weeks.[46] Written by Kim Eana and composed by Lee Min-soo, the pop ballad duet was used as one of the theme songs for the second season of the variety show We Got Married.[47] Soon after, IU released "Because I'm a Woman" (Korean: ????), one of the theme songs of MBC's historical drama, Road No. 1. The song peaked at number six on the Gaon Digital Chart.[48] IU's collaboration with Sung Si-kyung on "It's You" (Korean: ????) for his album, The First, debuted at number one on the Gaon Digital Chart.[49]


"Good Day"

IU's third EP, Real, was released on December 9, 2010. Produced by Jo Yeong-cheol and Choi Gap-won, Real debuted at number four on the Gaon Album Chart.[52][53] The lead single, "Good Day" (Korean: ?? ?), reunited IU with lyricist Kim Eana and composer Lee Min-soo after "Nagging", whom she would work with again on the lead singles of her next two studio albums. The uptempo song, as explained by Kim Eana, is about "a shy girl who is nervous about expressing her feelings to the boy she likes."[54] During the album's promotional period, IU also topped the charts on the music programs M Countdown, Music Bank, and Inkigayo.[55][56][57] Both Kim Eana and Lee Min-soo considered the main factors of the song's success to be the use of the word oppa (Korean: ??) in the chorus, as well as the three high-pitched notes that IU sings in semitone increments during the climax of the song.[58] In addition to receiving praise for her vocal abilities, IU's fan base also expanded to a more varied demographic as compared to other K-pop groups.[51][59] Billboard magazine ranked "Good Day" at number one on their list "100 Greatest K-pop Songs of the 2010s".[2]

To maintain public visibility, IU joined the cast of the variety show Heroes, which aired from July 18, 2010, to May 1, 2011.[28] Speaking fondly of the show, IU recalled the camaraderie she built with the other regular cast members despite the hectic two-day shooting schedules which only allowed them two-three hours of sleep.[60] Shortly after joining Heroes, IU was cast in teen drama Dream High. Filming ran from December 2010 to February 2011, during which time she remained committed to Heroes and her existing promotions for "Good Day".[61] In her first acting role, IU played Kim Pil-sook, a shy and overweight school girl who dreams of becoming a professional singer. Admitting that she was doubtful about her readiness to take on acting, IU remarked that she gained confidence in learning that the part would require singing and would later describe the experience as a tremendously enjoyable one.[32][59] For the series' soundtrack, she released the single, "Someday", which achieved number-one position on the Gaon Digital Chart on the week of January 30 每 February 5, 2011.[62] By the end of 2011, the single had sold 2,209,924 digital copies and is one of IU's best-selling singles for a soundtrack.[63]

A follow-up extended play to Real was released on February 16, 2011, with the title, Real+, containing three songs.[64] The lead single, "Only I Didn't Know" (Korean: ?? ??? ???), was composed by singer-songwriter Yoon Sang with lyrics written by Kim Eana. Yoon Sang wrote the song for IU after spotting her momentary sad expression on a television broadcast.[65] The ballad's tone was a departure from her more recent releases, with IU describing it as dark, sad and sentimental, which is closer to her music preference.[21][59] The song performed well commercially, debuting at number one on the Gaon Digital Chart.[66]

IU took on various side-projects after the end of Dream High. On March 10, 2011, IU performed as the opening act for British singer-songwriter Corinne Bailey Rae's first solo concert in Seoul with two songs, before joining Bailey Rae during her performance of "Put Your Records On".[67] Bailey Rae, whom IU described as her role model, said of IU, "It's incredible that her voice is so soulful even though she's young."[68] In the same month, IU was appointed as one of the new hosts of the music program, Inkigayo, a position which she held until July 2013.[69] In May 2011, IU recorded her first self-composed song, "Hold My Hand" (Korean: ? ?? ??), for the romantic-comedy television series, The Greatest Love.[70] The song peaked at number two on the Gaon Digital Chart and sold 2,031,787 digital copies in 2011.[63][71] Between May and July 2011, IU took part in the reality ice-skating competition series, Kim Yuna's Kiss & Cry, as a celebrity contestant until she was eliminated in the eighth episode.[72][73] During this time, she also participated in Immortal Songs: Singing the Legend but eventually withdrew after recording one episode due to her overwhelming schedule.[74][75] On her wide-ranging activities in entertainment, IU remarked that while singing, acting, and variety are all difficult, she finds variety to be the most tiring.[76]

IU's second studio album, Last Fantasy, was released on November 29, 2011.[77] The Korea JoongAng Daily described the album as one that would "suit all kinds of musical tastes and fans", while Billboard noted the "cinematic feel" of the album as set by the opening track, "Secret".[78][79] Produced by Jo Yeong-cheol, whom IU worked with on Real, the album contains collaborative works with singer-songwriters such as Yoon Sang, Lee Juck and Ra.D. The total number of download sales made from the album's tracks exceeded 10 million within the first two weeks.[80] Eight out of the album's thirteen songs debuted in the top ten on the Gaon Digital Chart, while the album debuted at number one on the Gaon Album Chart.[81][82] The main single, "You & I" (Korean: ?? ?), became IU's most commercially successful single with almost 5.5 million digital copies sold by the end of 2012.[83] It topped the Gaon Chart as well as the newly established Billboard K-pop Hot 100 chart at the time of release.[82][84]

Shortly before the release of Last Fantasy, IU signed with EMI Music Japan (now part of Universal Music Japan) as a precursor to her entry into the Japanese market.[85] A selection of her previously released songs was compiled into an extended play called I↓U that was released in Japan on December 14, 2011.[86]

2012: Japanese debut and first solo concert tour

As promotions for Last Fantasy and its main single "You & I" continued into 2012 in South Korea, IU began preparations for her debut in Japan by playing two shows at the Bunkamura Orchard Hall in Shibuya, Tokyo to an audience of about 4,000 people on January 24, 2012.[33] She performed six songs including her debut single, "Lost Child", and the Japanese version of "Good Day" with the support of either a live orchestra or her own acoustic guitar accompaniment.[33][87] Subsequent to the concert, both "Good Day" and "You & I" were released as new singles in Japan with translated lyrics to moderate success. According to Japan's Oricon Singles Chart, the single album of Good Day sold 21,000 physical copies on the first week of release with the single debuting on the chart at number six.[88] On the Billboard Japan Hot 100, "Good Day" peaked at number 5.[89] "You & I" peaked at number four on the Oricon Singles Chart and number eleven on the Billboard Japan Hot 100.[90][91] In support of her Japanese single releases, IU toured five cities〞Tokyo, Sapporo, Nagoya, Osaka and Fukuoka〞in a mini-concert series called IU Friendship Showcase - Spring 2012.[92]

IU embarked on her first concert tour, Real Fantasy, in June 2012. She played shows in six different cities across South Korea, starting with two shows in Seoul.[93] The opening shows on June 2每3 were sold out within 30 minutes of the tickets going on sale on April 17.[94] It was reported that 43.8% of ticket purchasers were between the ages of 20 and 29, while 71% were male, which was considered uncommon for a K-pop concert.[94] The tour continued to Ulsan, Jeonju, Suwon, Busan and Daegu, before returning to Seoul with two encore concerts that ended on September 23, 2012.[95] Guest performers included Ra.D, Lim Seul-ong and Lee Seung-gi.[96]

Due to her commitments towards preparing for her first solo tour, IU was unable to make broadcast promotions for her fifth Korean extended play, Spring of a Twenty Year Old (Korean: ?? ?? ?), which was released on May 11, 2012. The album, named to celebrate IU turning the Korean age of 20, contains three songs with the lead single being "Peach" (Korean: ???).[97] Self-composed by IU, "Peach" peaked at number two on the Gaon Digital Chart and number three on the Billboard K-pop Hot 100.[98][99] The second single released from the album was "Every End of the Day" (Korean: ?? ?), which topped the Gaon Digital Chart for two weeks and the Billboard K-pop Hot 100 for four weeks.[3][100] In place of the usual 4每5 minute music video that usually accompanies a single release, a 26-minute-long documentary-style music film was shot in Venice and Burano and released alongside the album, featuring both "Peach" and "Every End of the Day".[97]

IU returned to Japan on September 17, 2012, to perform one show, titled IU Friendship Special Concert 〞 Autumn 2012, at the Tokyo International Forum to a crowd of over 5,000 people.[101] With Sunny Hill as a guest act, IU performed a mixture of her own songs and covers of Korean and Japanese songs such as "Juliette" by Shinee, "Friend" by Anzen Chitai and "Aishiteru" from the Natsume's Book of Friends anime series.[102] Live recordings of "Friend" and "Aishiteru" from the event were later released as promotional digital singles. Nearing the end of her Real Fantasy tour and promotions in Japan, IU resumed her hosting duties on Inkigayo after taking a three-month leave due to concert commitments.[103] She also became the host of MBC's short-lived television quiz show, Quiz Show Q, alongside Park Myeong-su and Sun Bom Soo.[104] On December 29, IU hosted the 2012 SBS Gayo Daejeon, an annual music program, alongside Bae Suzy and actor Jung Gyu-woon. She was selected by the program's producer for her MC skills that she demonstrated on Inkigayo.[105]

For her accomplishments over the past year, IU won two awards at the 2012 Seoul Music Awards; Last Fantasy was named Record of the Year, while she was among the ten musical acts who were awarded the Main Prize.[106] At the Korean Music Awards, "Good Day" was named Song of the Year and Best Pop Song, while she was named Female Musician of the Year (Netizen Vote).[107] Billboard magazine named IU as one of the hottest musicians under 21 years old in 2012 for her "unique charm and undeniable hits [that] have made her into a bona fide superstar".[3]

2013: First starring roles and Modern Times

IU at a Modern Times concert in Busan, South Korea, on December 1, 2013.
IU started 2013 by taking on her first leading role in a television series, playing the title role in You're the Best, Lee Soon-shin. Her character was described as a "loser" who is seemingly average in every way except for her daring and bright personality, which helps her to overcome hardships.[108] Despite the worries of casting someone who is better known as a singer in the role, director Yoon Sung-sik decided to cast IU after seeing her performance in Dream High and thought that she suited the image he had envisioned for the character.[109] Her co-stars Go Doo-shim and Lee Ji-hoon, as well as the production crew, praised her performance, especially during emotional scenes.[110][111][112] As the series progressed, IU's performance garnered positive critical reviews despite early reservations shown about her casting, with the viewership ratings reaching a peak of 30.8%.[113][114] She was nominated for the Excellence in Acting Award (Best Actress in a Serial Drama) at the 2013 KBS Drama Awards. For the drama, she released a recording with her co-star Jo Jung-suk of her self-composed duet, "Beautiful Song" (Korean: ????), which was not included on the official soundtrack.[115]

In the same period, IU released her second Japanese extended-play album, Can You Hear Me?, featuring her first original Japanese songs. Two tracks from the album were released as singles; "Beautiful Dancer" and "New World" peaked at number 66 and 76 respectively on the Billboard Japan Hot 100, ranking significantly lower than her Japanese-translated versions of "Good Day" and "You & I", which were top 10 releases.[116] Rolling Stone Japan gave the album a positive review, highlighting "Beautiful Dancer" and "Truth" as stand-out tracks.[117] In an interview with Oricon, IU recalled how shocked and touched she was to receive "Beautiful Dancer" and "Truth" from R&B producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis.[118] Her next Japanese single, "Monday Afternoon", was released on September 11, 2013, debuting at number 27 on Billboard Japan Hot 100 chart and number 9 on Japan's Oricon Daily Chart.[119][120]

Almost two years after Last Fantasy, IU released her third studio album, Modern Times, on October 8, 2013. It was described to be "a big shift from the young singer's K-pop roots" that showcased a "more mature and sophisticated sound and image" than her previous work.[121] IU composed and wrote two out of the album's 13 tracks, which ranged from swing to jazz, bossa nova, Latin pop and folk genres.[122] The diversity of jazz styles and the mix of collaborative tracks were highlighted in reviews by Billboard and The Korea Herald.[4][123] Billboard described the album as one that features "throwback vibes with a modern twist a la Christina Aguilera's Back to Basics record", with IU proving to have "musical sensibilities well beyond a typical 20-year-old".[4] The Korea Herald wrote: "...vintage sounds and modern effects are put together artfully, forming a fresh but familiar compilation of songs. Modern Times has a distinct carefree feel that is reminiscent of jazz during the Roaring Twenties."[123] Modern Times debuted at number one on the Gaon Album Chart, while seven of its tracks achieved top ten positions on the Gaon Digital Chart with the lead single, "The Red Shoes" (Korean: ???), placing in the number one position.[124][125] Similarly, the album debuted number four on Billboard's World Albums Chart, with twelve tracks in the K-pop Hot 100 chart.[126][127] The album was ranked number two on Billboard's "25 Greatest K-Pop Albums of the 2010s" list.[5]

On the second week of her promotional activities for Modern Times, IU decided to join the romantic-comedy series Bel Ami.[128] She played the "quirky" and "playful" role of Kim Bo-tong, a carefree girl in her twenties who has had an unrequited crush on the male protagonist since high school.[128] For her performance, IU was nominated in the Outstanding Korean Actress category at the 2014 Seoul International Drama Awards.[129] In support of Modern Times, IU held her second concert tour with three shows which took place on November 23每24, 2013, at Kyung Hee University's Peace Hall in Seoul and ended on December 1, 2013, at KBS Hall in Busan.[130] Promotions for Modern Times progressed into 2014 with IU performing in Hong Kong for the first time in a solo concert.[131] A repackaged version of Modern Times, titled Modern Times 〞 Epilogue, was released on December 20, 2013, with two additional tracks: "Friday" (Korean: ???? ???) and "Pastel Crayon" (Korean: ????). Her self-composed track, "Friday", was originally intended to be included in Modern Times but was later released as the lead single of Modern Times 〞 Epilogue.[132] Described as a "mid-tempo, bossa nova number", "Friday" held the number one position on the Billboard Korea K-pop Hot 100 chart for two weeks after release.[84][133] The lead single was successful on the Gaon Digital Chart, peaking at number one, and became the tenth best-selling digital single of 2014.[134][135]

2014: A Flower Bookmark

IU at the 2014 Melon Music Awards
IU released her sixth Korean extended-play and first cover album, A Flower Bookmark (Korean: ???), on May 16, 2014. The album contains seven renditions of tracks that hailed from the 1980s and 1990s with a mixture of genres that included ballad, dance, folk and rock.[136] The album came about at the request of fans and due to the positive feedback she had previously received for her cover songs.[137] Three tracks debuted in the top ten of the Gaon Digital Chart on the week of release, with the main single, "My Old Story" (Korean: ?? ?? ???), ultimately peaking at number 2.[138][139] However, it was her collaboration with Kim Chang-wan on the remake of his 1984 song, "The Meaning of You" (Korean: ?? ??), that became the best-selling track from the album and also her best-selling single of 2014.[140] The album was well received by The Korea Times for providing "a pleasant, calming respite from the mainstream music of today's times", and praised IU for her reinterpretations: "For every track, IU keeps a careful balance between preserving the song's original sentiments and altering the original with her own color and arrangements."[141] Billboard highlighted the track, "Pierrot Smiles at Us" (Korean: ???? ?? ?? ??), as the "most ambitious tune she tackled" and one that proved her diversity as a singer.[78]

IU's wish to conduct a more intimate and smaller scale concert was fulfilled in her third solo Korean concert series, "Just One Step... That Much More".[142] The concert series took place over eight nights from May 22 to June 1 at Sogang University's Mary Hall, which had a capacity of 450 people.[143] Tickets to all eight shows were sold out within 10 minutes of release on May 7, 2014.[143] As well as playing the keyboard for the first time on stage, IU performed all the seven songs from A Flower Bookmark among various new arrangements of her earlier songs.[142] Guest acts included Kim Jong-hyun, Jung Yong-hwa, Hwang Kwanghee, Kim Bum-soo, Lim Seul-ong, Jo Jung-suk, Ha Dong-kyun and Akdong Musician.[144] Profits made from the concerts were donated to the victims of the Sewol Ferry Disaster.[145]

I think I need to study English for the next visit to the U.S. It's suffocating not being able to communicate with fans..."[148]

In 2015, two years after her last acting role, IU starred alongside Kim Soo-hyun, Cha Tae-hyun, and Gong Hyo-jin in The Producers , which was named as one of the most anticipated TV series of the year in South Korea.[158] She played Cindy, a diva-like singer who decides to participate in a variety show to improve her public image. Analysing her character's perceived icy demeanor, IU commented that she could relate to her character's "biting attitude" and how similar her character was to herself.[158] The series and IU's portrayal of Cindy were met with lukewarm reviews at the premier but both the viewership and critical response improved over the course of the series, peaking at 17.7% viewership for the last episode.[159][160] She performed two songs in character, "Twenty Three" and "Heart" (Korean: ??), both of which were later included as bonus tracks on her 2015 album, Chat-Shire. While she wrote the lyrics for both songs, she also composed the music for "Heart", which was released as a digital single on May 18. "Heart" topped the charts upon its release and went on to become the tenth best-selling digital single of 2015 in South Korea.[161][162] "Heart" was among a slew of K-pop songs used by South Korea's Defense Ministry in its propaganda broadcasts to North Korea during the two countries' tense standoff in August 2015, with the aim of advertising the "South Korean youth culture".[163][164] Through The Producers, IU's popularity in China soared〞reportedly receiving offers for several projects from Chinese companies.[165]

After the completion of The Producers, IU participated in the biennial music festival event hosted by the variety show, Infinite Challenge, in which each participating singer-songwriter is partnered with one of the six hosts to create a song for the festival. The preparation process and festival event were aired over the course of seven episodes.

"Leon" reached number one on all of South Korea's music charts upon release.[167]

IU's seventh Korean extended play, Chat-Shire, was released digitally on October 23, 2015, prior to its physical release on October 27.

Despite positive critical reviews and success in the music charts, the album became controversial due to the lyrics of "Zez谷" and the audio samples used in the bonus track "Twenty Three" (not to be confused with the similarly titled lead single).[171] On November 4, the Korean publisher of the novel My Sweet Orange Tree, from which IU drew inspiration for the song "Zez谷", stirred debate in the entertainment industry on freedom of interpretation when it leveled criticisms at IU for her interpretation of the five-year-old protagonist as a "sexual object".[172][173] Two days later, IU issued a public statement: "I did not mean to turn Zeze into a sexual object... but I realize that my lyrics have offended many, and for this I apologize."[172] On November 10, the publisher released an apology for its failure to acknowledge "diversity of interpretation."[172][173] For the bonus track "Twenty Three", voice samples from Britney Spears' "Gimme More" were allegedly used without permission.[174] Billboard ranked Chat-Shire the sixth best K-pop album of 2015, explaining that "IU knows how to take the sounds of yesterday and update them to stunning results."[175]

Prior to the release of Chat-Shire, LOEN announced that IU would not be partaking in broadcast promotions for the album and would instead be holding a national tour from November to December 2015.[176] The Chat-Shire tour began in Seoul on November 21 and continued to Busan, Daegu and Gwangju, before returning to Seoul, where it ended on December 31.[177][178] In the midst of her concert tour for Chat-Shire in South Korea, IU also increased promotional activities in Hong Kong, China and Taiwan, hosting fan-meetings and concerts in various cities as well as releasing a compilation album, Smash Hits, to the Taiwanese market on December 11, 2015.[179] Containing 16 previously released songs, Smash Hits was published by Warner Music Taiwan and topped the K-pop album chart of Taiwan's leading online music store, KKBOX, on its first week of release.[180] Tickets to her concert of January 10, 2016, in Taiwan also sold out within two minutes of going on sale.[181] Towards the end of 2015, IU hosted SBS's annual end-of-year music program, Gayo Daejeon, with Shin Dong-yup. The program's producers said of their host selection, "IU has been deeply acknowledged for her musical talents, moving beyond the image of 'Korea's cute younger sister'."[182] For her accomplishments in 2015, Ize listed IU as one of the "Persons of the Year", while GQ Korea named her as the "Woman of the Year".[183][184]
